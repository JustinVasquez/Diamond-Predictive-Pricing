# Diamond-Predictive-Pricing
### Summary
This notebook is a project to predict the potential profit to be made by buying and reselling diamonds, given a limited budget. 
With the dataset that was provided, I created a model to predict both the price paid to acquire the diamond, as well as the retail price the diamonds would resell for and select the ones that would return the largest profit, without exceeding the $5 million limit. 

The training and testing datasets are labeled 'training.csv' and 'offers.csv', as shown when imported in the notebook. 

As the datasets were provided as part of a case study for a company, I will not include them in this repository. 

The notebook contains more details describing the entire process.
